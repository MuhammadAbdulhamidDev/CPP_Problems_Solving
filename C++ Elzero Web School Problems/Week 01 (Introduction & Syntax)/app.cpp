  /*The <iostream> header file in C++ provides several functions for input and output operations. Some of the commonly used functions in <iostream> header file are:

std::cin: This is used for input operations, allowing the user to enter data from the keyboard. It is associated with the standard input stream, usually connected to the keyboard.

std::cout: This is used for output operations, allowing the program to display data on the console. It is associated with the standard output stream, usually connected to the console or terminal.

std::endl: This is used to insert a new line character ('\n') into the output stream and flush the buffer, effectively moving the cursor to the next line.

std::cerr: This is used for error output operations, allowing the program to display error messages on the console. It is associated with the standard error stream, usually connected to the console or terminal.

std::setw(): This is used to set the width of the output field, which can be used to align output data in a specific format.

std::setprecision(): This is used to set the precision of floating-point numbers when displayed as output.

std::fixed: This is used to specify that floating-point numbers should be displayed in fixed-point notation instead of scientific notation.

std::boolalpha: This is used to specify that true and false should be displayed as "true" and "false" respectively, instead of the default numeric representation of 1 and 0.

std::hex: This is used to specify that integer values should be displayed in hexadecimal notation.

std::oct: This is used to specify that integer values should be displayed in octal notation.

std::dec: This is used to specify that integer values should be displayed in decimal notation (the default).

These are some of the common functions provided by the <iostream> header file in C++ for performing input and output operations in the console window.*/
